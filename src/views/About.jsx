							. Surviving 2020 is a web project I built with the aim of connecting people during the very unusual
							year that was 2020. With four different phrases, I invite you to express yourself by sharing your
							emotions, experiences and thoughts with people around the world.
							<br />
							<br />
							I hope this project brings you a little bit of joy, knowing that you are not alone, but most
							importantly, that you survived 2020!
